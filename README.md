CS300 Course Management Program

-This repository contains selected portions of projects completed during the CS300 course, showcasing my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Contents

Analysis of Data Structures (Project One)

- A detailed analysis of runtime and memory usage for three data structures: Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree (BST).

Course Sorting and Printing Code (Project Two)

- A C++ implementation to sort and print a list of courses in alphanumeric order using efficient data structures.



Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem was designing and implementing a system to manage and display course information for a Computer Science program. This included reading data from a file, storing it in efficient data structures, and enabling operations like sorting and searching while optimizing runtime and memory usage.

How did you approach the problem?

I began by analyzing the requirements and evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of different data structures (Vector, Hash Table, and BST). I selected the Hash Table for its average-case efficiency and implemented file parsing, data storage, and sorting functionality using modular and structured programming techniques.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Some challenges included handling file parsing errors, validating prerequisites, and ensuring that sorting worked correctly for large datasets. To overcome these, I leveraged pseudocode for clarity, wrote test cases to validate logic, and applied error-handling techniques to improve robustness.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structure for a problem. It also deepened my understanding of algorithm efficiency and the trade-offs between runtime performance and memory consumption. Additionally, I gained experience in designing modular and reusable code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I have improved my use of in-line comments, clear naming conventions, and modular functions. These practices enhance code readability and make future adaptations or extensions easier. I also incorporated error handling and edge-case testing, which are crucial for building reliable programs.
